## Introduction

A little about me:

* Currently Executive Director at [Excelsior College](http://excelsior.edu)
	* Principal Investigator for a Department of Education Grant (part of their FIPSE First in the World program) to develop a Diagnostic Assessment and Achievement of College Skills ([www.DAACS.net](http://www.daacs.net))
* Authored over a dozen R packages including:
	* [likert](http://github.com/jbryer/likert)
	* [sqlutils](http://github.com/jbryer/sqlutils)
	* [timeline](http://github.com/jbryer/timeline)
* Specialize in propensity score methods. Three new methods/R packages developed include:
	* [multilevelPSA](http://github.com/jbryer/multilevelPSA)
	* [TriMatch](http://github.com/jbryer/TriMatch)
	* [PSAboot](http://github.com/jbryer/PSAboot)

## Syllabus

Syllabus and course materials are here: [http://data606.net](http://data606.net)

The site is built using the [Blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/jbryer/DATA606Spring2019).

We will use Blackboard primary only for submitting assignments. Please submit:

* A PDF or link to the built HTML (e.g. Rpubs, [Github](http://htmlpreview.github.io/))
* For labs, also include your Rmarkdown file

## Assignments

* Getting Acquainted (1%)
* [Homework](http://data606.net/assignments/homework/) (16%)
	* Approximately six problems per chapter.
	* Answers can be handwritten or typed (I suggest using R Markdown)
	* Submit a PDF on Blackboard.
* [Labs](http://data606.net/assignments/labs/) (40%)
	* Labs are designed to introduce to you doing statistics with R.
	* Answer the questions in the main text as well as the "On Your Own" section.
	* Submit both the R Markdown file and PDF of the output on Blackboard.
* [Data Project](http://data606.net/assignments/project/) (20%)
	* This allows you to analyze a dataset of your choosing. Projects will be shared with the class. This provides an opportunity for everyone to see different approaches to analyzing different datasets.
	* Proposal is due March 7th (5%); Final project is due May 16th (15%).
* Final exam (18%)
* [Meetup Presentation](http://data606.net/assignments/presentation/) (5%)
	* Present one practice problem during our weekly meetups. Signup using the [Google Spreadsheet](http://data606.net/course-overview/meetups).

## The `DATA606` R Package

The package can be installed from Github using the `devtools` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('jbryer/DATA606')
```

### Important Functions

* `library('DATA606')` - Load the package
* `vignette(package='DATA606')` - Lists vignettes in the DATA606 package
* `vignette('os3')` - Loads a PDF of the OpenIntro Statistics book
* `data(package='DATA606')` - Lists data available in the package
* `getLabs()` - Returns a list of the available labs
* `viewLab('Lab0')` - Opens Lab0 in the default web browser
* `startLab('Lab0')` - Starts Lab0 (copies to getwd()), opens the Rmd file
* `shiny_demo()` - Lists available Shiny apps

## Using R Markdown

R Markdown files are provided for all the labs. You can start a lab using the `DATA606::startLab` function.

However, creating new R Markdown files in RStudio can be done by clicking `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`.
